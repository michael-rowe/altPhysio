<p>This is the GitHub home of a project that aims to create an open source physiotherapy curriculum that can be reproduced, edited and re-shared with others.</p>

<h3>Curriculum</h3>
<p>This curriculum takes as it's base the WCPT core curriculum guidelines and as such includes a 4 year undergraduate programme that builds a set of competencies as described by the WCPT. However, it takes a significant department from more mainstream curricula in terms of the learning and teaching activities suggested in the curriculum.</p>
