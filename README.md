# openPhysio

*openPhysio* is an experiment in creating a collaborative, open source physiotherapy curriculum. See the project wiki (https://github.com/michael-rowe/openPhysio/wiki) for more detailed information.

## Description


## Contributing
Anyone can contribute to this curriculum, or fork it and create their own version that can be edited, improved and shared with others. GitHub does _collaboration_ very well and makes it pretty simple for anyone to commit changes to the project.

## Branches
This project has two main branches; _master_ and _draft_. The master branch is the most stable version of the curriculum and doesn't contain too much that might be considered experimental. As much as possible we also try to keep it relatively clear of unfinished work. This means that pages and curriculum components that are still in progress and kept in _draft_. Once changes have been finalised and agreed they are merged from _draft_ into _master_.

## Installation
In the context of this project, _installation_ actually means _cloning_ the Master branch of the repository so that you have the most complete version of the curriculum in your own account. You can then continue working on it if you want, or simply download it and now you have your own curriculum.

## Licensing

## Credits
The project is maintained by Michael Rowe, a physiotherapy lecturer at the University of the Western Cape in Cape Town, South Africa.
