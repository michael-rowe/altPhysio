# Mission

The mission of openPhysio is to describe a modern physiotherapy curriculum that addresses some of the limitations that arise from traditional conceptions of what a curriculum is.

The purpose of openPhysio is to:

1. Describe a competency-based curriculum
1. Provide a new way of conceptualising the concept of a curriculum
1. Use technology to present the curriculum in different ways
1. Enable collaboration, editing and sharing of the curriculum
