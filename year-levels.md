[WCPT](http://www.wcpt.org/ "Link to the World Confederation of Physical Therapy") requires that all affiliated physiotherapy programmes include a 4 year degree programme. openPhysio therefore recommends 4 years of study for undergradudates, with each year level roughly conforming to Milestones found in the the Key and Enabling Competencies. However, we suggest that implementers of openPhysio recognise that some Competencies and Milestones will bridge year levels. For this reason, end of year examinations make it difficult to constrain the development of Competencies and Roles to arbitrary single calender year divisions.
