# Roles
Roles are the high level descriptors of what we want a professional physiotherapist to be able to do upon graduation. Roles are described with Competencies. In order to develop Competencies within these Roles, students work on Projects.

The Roles for physiotherapists are taken from the CanMeds framework:
1. Clinical expert
2. Communicator
3. Collaborator
4. Health advocate
5. Scholar
6. Professional

Within each of these Roles is a set of Key Competencies and Enabling Competencies that are described using Milestones.
